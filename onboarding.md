### Checklist

1. A documentation ticket to improve our documentation and to get you acquainted with our development and deployment pipeline.

2. Fix a small technical issue using some technology you already know. This will be close to vanilla Python/Django or Javascript/Vue.js.

3. A more challenging technical issue, this time you will get to work with a part of our stack that is new to you.

4. Now you are ready to dive into our business domain and solve a substantive issue for one of our products and its users.
