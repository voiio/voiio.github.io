## Meetings & Collaboration

### Stakeholder Meetings

Stakeholder meetings are held weekly to discuss the product roadmap, upcoming features,

It is the best path to discuss new ideas and to align on the product's direction.

The meeting is led by the Product Manager and attended by key stakeholders and an engineering lead.

### Refinement Meetings

Refinement meetings are held weekly and are the handover point from the Product Team to the Engineering Team.
The product manager presents problems, opportunities and priorities to the Engineering Team.
Engineers ask questions and either pull the problem into the backlog or push it back to the product team for further refinement.

The meeting is led by the product manager and attended by the engineering team.

### Standups

Standups are held daily and are the heartbeat of the Engineering Team.
They are used to update the team on the progress of ongoing tasks and blockers.
Standups are not for problem-solving but for identifying issues
that need to be solved later during the day.

Standups are led by the Engineering Team Lead and attended by the entire Engineering Team
and, optionally, by product managers or designers.
