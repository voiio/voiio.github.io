# Welcome

voiio is closing the gap between having to manage your job and private life.
We are a German based B2B employee service provider, always creating new
services that have a meaningful impact on people's every day lives.

This document contains all information related to our software engineering,
here at voiio. You will find documentation on our hiring processes and
a glimpse into our day-to-day lives.


## Why and how we do, what we do?

### Our Vision

Even in an age of AI, people are the primary long term success factor of any enterprise.
We believe that retaining, developing, motivating and supporting employees can be achieved
by providing businesses and their leaders with the right tools and services.

### Our Mission

We build services and products that have a meaningful impact
on people's every day work and private lives.


### Our Company Values

Our values are the foundation of our work and team culture.

#### 1. Transparency, especially where it hurts.

Kind candor is the foundation of our culture. We are honest and direct with each other.
We are not afraid to speak up and address problems. We are not afraid to ask for help.

#### 2. Don't talk, act!

We are a team of doers. We don't only talk about problems, we solve them. We don't only talk about
ideas, we implement them. We don't talk about people, we talk to them.

#### 3. There are no silver medals.

We get up in the morning to compete for gold, not for silver.
We will fail, but we don't start something with a failure mindset.

#### 4. If you gotta work, it better be fun!

Work is a major part of our lives. Therefore, we want to do work,
that fulfills us and that we enjoy. If we don't, we are but a penguin on land â€“
not in our element.

#### 5. Unite people, don't divide.

In a world that is more and more divided, we want to bring people together.
We don't judge people, we educate them. We don't blame people, we help them.

#### 6. Give strength, when others need it.

We take care of our own. We are here for you, should you need our help.
But we expect you give strength to others, whenever you can.

### Our Product Principles

Our product principles are the secret sauce that makes our products extra special.

#### 1. thoughtful

We care about the details. Every interaction should be thoughtful and intentional.
A user should feel that we deeply care about the product we are building.
Small things matter.

#### 2. inspiring

We want to inspire people to do new things. We build products and services
that exceed our customers wildest dreams. Cars, not faster horses.

#### 3. clutch

We want to be the best at what we do.
We want to be the clutch player that everyone wants on their team.

#### 4. no bs

We don't keep bullshit around. If it doesn't add value, it needs to go.
Embrace your inner Marie Kondo.

for everyone. Therefore, the following [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) applies to
all our public repositories, office interactions and social events.

## Philosophy

<!--//

#### CTO's mission statement

```
I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To merge them is my real test
To deploy them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach contributors to understand
The power that's inside
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (It's you and me)
I know it's my destiny
Pull-Requests! Oh you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (A heart so true)
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all (gotta merge'em all!)
Yeah!
Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place
Come with me
The time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream!
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (It's you and me)
I know it's my destiny
Pull-Requests! Oh you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (A heart so true)
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge'em all (gotta merge 'em all!)
Gotta merge'em all!
Gotta merge'em all!
Gotta merge'em all!
Yeah!
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (It's you and me)
I know it's my destiny
Pull-Requests! Oh you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (A heart so true)
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge'em all (gotta merge 'em all, Pull-Requests!)
```

### Open Source

Almost our entire stack is based upon open source tools and libraries and all platforms
we build upon have a strong relationship with open source and free software.

Please check out [our open source policy](open_source.md) for more information.

### Our Stack

Good chefs keep their knifes sharp. We believe the same is true for software engineers,
which is why we always aim to use the best tools available and don't mind investing into
our setup.

You can find our full tech stack on [stackshare.io/voiio](https://stackshare.io/voiio).

We use [dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) to keep all our Python and NodeJS
dependencies up to date on a daily basis.

AI hype did not pass us by. We are passionate about new discoveries in this field and
are always looking for ways to improve our services with it.
There is even a small collection of [prompts for LLMs](prompts.md)
that we are using internally.

### Coding Style

We don't have too many convention. We have black for Python, Standard for JavaScript and
styling setup with pre-commit all repositories. We want to make sure that code is
simple and readable, to make reviewing for our fellow engineers more fun.

We have a small collections of things, that we want to stick to, if possible in our
[style guide](https://github.com/voiio/voiio.github.io/blob/main/scss_style_guide.md).

### DevOps and QA

We do not hire dedicated DevOps and QA engineers. We do not hire DevOps engineers
because we are not in the business of running data centers, but improving family's lives.
We use Heroku and AWS to worry about most DevOps related problems and have a full CD
pipeline setup for our applications.

We believe that writing automated tests for your own code helps you to deliver better
results and become a better engineer. Therefore, we do not have dedicated QA engineers.
For us, writing tests is part of writing features.
