## Welcome

voiio is closing the gap between having to manage your job and your family.
We are a German based B2B family service provider.

This document contains all information related to our software engineering here at
voiio. You will find documentation on our hiring processes and a glimpse into our day to
day lives.

### Join Us!

We are excited that you are interested in joining our team. Our hiring process consists
of five simple steps:

1.  your application
2.  a quick phone call
3.  coding challenge (optional)
4.  the interview
5.  a reference check

You can find more information about our application process in our
[application guide](apply.md).

### Our Stack

Good chefs keep their knifes sharp. We believe the same is true for software engineers,
which is why we always aim to use the best tools available and don't mind investing into
our setup.

You can find our full tech stack on [stackshare.io/voiio](https://stackshare.io/voiio).

We use [dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) to keep all our Python and NodeJS
dependencies up to date on a daily base.

### devOps and QA

We do not hire dedicated devOps and QA engineers. We do not hire devOps engineers
because we are not in the business of running data centers but improving family's lives.
We use Heroku and AWS to worry about most devOps related problems and have a full CD
pipeline setup for our applications.

We believe that writing automated tests for your own code helps you to deliver better
results and become a better engineer. Therefor, we do not have dedicated QA engineers.
For us writing tests is part of writing features.
