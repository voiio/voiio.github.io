### Philosophy

<!--//

#### CTO's mission statement

```
I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To merge them is my real test
To deploy them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach contributors to understand
The power that's inside
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (It's you and me)
I know it's my destiny
Pull-Requests! Oh you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (A heart so true)
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all (gotta merge'em all!)
Yeah!
Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place
Come with me
The time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream!
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (It's you and me)
I know it's my destiny
Pull-Requests! Oh you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (A heart so true)
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge'em all (gotta merge 'em all!)
Gotta merge'em all!
Gotta merge'em all!
Gotta merge'em all!
Yeah!
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (It's you and me)
I know it's my destiny
Pull-Requests! Oh you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge 'em all! (A heart so true)
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pull-Requests! Gotta merge'em all (gotta merge 'em all, Pull-Requests!)

#### Code of Conduct

We take great pride in providing a workspace and atmosphere that is productive and safe
for everyone. Therefore, the following [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) applies to
all our public repositories, office interactions and social events.

#### Open Source

Almost our entire stack is based upon open source tools and libraries and all platforms
we build upon have a strong relationship with open source and free software.

Please check out [our open source policy](open_source.md) for more information.

#### Our Stack

Good chefs keep their knifes sharp. We believe the same is true for software engineers,
which is why we always aim to use the best tools available and don't mind investing into
our setup.

You can find our full tech stack on [stackshare.io/voiio](https://stackshare.io/voiio).

We use [dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) to keep all our Python and NodeJS
dependencies up to date on a daily basis.


#### Coding Style

We don't have too many conventstion. We have black for Python, Standard for JavaScript and
Styleling setup with precommit all preos. We want to make sure that code is simple and
readable, to make reviewing for our fellow engineers more fun.

We have a small collections of things, that we want to stick to, if possible in our
[style guide](https://github.com/voiio/voiio.github.io/blob/main/scss_style_guide.md).


#### DevOps and QA

We do not hire dedicated DevOps and QA engineers. We do not hire DevOps engineers
because we are not in the business of running data centers, but improving family's lives.
We use Heroku and AWS to worry about most DevOps related problems and have a full CD
pipeline setup for our applications.

We believe that writing automated tests for your own code helps you to deliver better
results and become a better engineer. Therefore, we do not have dedicated QA engineers.
For us, writing tests is part of writing features.
